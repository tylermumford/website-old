### Recent

My friend Scott had a great idea for a mobile game called *Falling Spikes*. It sounded cool, so I built it! Check out the [source code] (https://github.com/tylermumford/falling-spikes).

I worked on a web app called [JuxtaPros] with some friends. It's not online at the moment, but it was cool enough that it [might come back](http://juxtapros.com) sometime.

### Sold

[Goodness] has been my most successful project: a Chrome extension designed to help people overcome pornography addictions. It sold in 2013 with about 11,000 users, and has since grown (unmodified, as best I can tell; you can still see my name in the screenshot) to many more than that.

### Retired

- [MLIx&#772;] is another Chrome extension. It was my attempt to improve the [My Life Is Average] interface.

- [Blue Ray] is a spartan, white-and-blue Chrome theme.

- [SubDiv] was my first Windows program, submitted as an entry in the [NANY 2010] challenge on [DonationCoder.com].

- [ÜberType] is a tiny Windows utility that let you type Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß very easily without using tricky shortcuts.
