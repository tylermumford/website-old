<div class="LI-profile-badge"  data-version="v1" data-size="medium" data-locale="en_US" data-type="horizontal" data-theme="light" data-vanity="tymumford"><a class="LI-simple-link" href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/tymumford?trk=profile-badge'>Tyler Mumford</a></div>

My career in a word: eager.

I started out as a programmer by going to the library and checking out an old book about HTML*. My family went camping that weekend, so I spent a lot of time in a chair just reading and absorbing the idea of HTML tags. I had to wait until we went home before I could try making any web pages, but I couldn't wait to learn how it all worked.

Over the years I've taken classes, gone to college, and worked several development jobs. I've started a bunch of side [projects](/projects.html) and even finished a few. I still enjoy learning about new programming languages, thinking about how to write software, and maintaining large codebases.

\* I know HTML isn't considered programming, but I was a kid, and that's what it felt like.
