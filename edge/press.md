## Tyler Mumford creates new iPhone game Falling Spikes

21 July, 2016. Cedar City, Utah.

SUU student and Computer Science major Tyler Mumford has just created a new iPhone game called Falling Spikes. Over the course of three months, Tyler developed the addicting game based on the ideas of his fellow student and friend, Scott Chapman. The game was made using Swift, the latest programming language from Apple, and it will soon be published on the App Store.

Tyler is a programmer with a background in making websites. Though a senior in the Computer Science department, this is his first attempt to create a new iPhone app. Falling Spikes has a simple premise—help a bouncing ball to dodge the deadly spikes—but the game's unpredictability and simplicity consistently deliver engaging fun to those who play it.

Tyler Mumford is employed as a Web Developer at Southern Utah University, where he is also enrolled as a student. Falling Spikes is his chosen EDGE project: Education Designed to Give Experience. Falling Spikes is the property of Scott Chapman and Tyler Mumford.
