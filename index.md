### About Me

My name is Tyler Mumford, and I'm a programmer. I mostly make websites, but I've dabbled in just about everything.

All of my published code is (so far) written in my spare time and (so far) freely available. Visit the [Projects] page for a list of my work.

### About Mindful Code

Mindful Code is the pseudo-company name under which I'll release certain projects that are as yet undecided. At one point, I thought that would mean iOS and Mac apps, but my interests have changed since then. Read the [first blog post] \(which is now pretty old) for more.
