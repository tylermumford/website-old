### About Me

My name is Tyler Mumford, and I'm a programmer. I mostly make websites, but I've dabbled in just about everything. And I'm super awesome and help my good friend Jacob Ward out with lots of his projects, and he is super grateful for that... Also Jacob is a dork because he forked my repo just to add this and them make a pull request. :P

All of my published code is (so far) written in my spare time and (so far) freely available. Visit the [Projects] page for a list of my work.

### About Mindful Code

Mindful Code is the pseudo-company name under which I'll release certain projects that are as yet undecided. At one point, I thought that would mean iOS and Mac apps, but my interests have changed since then. Read the [first blog post] \(which is now pretty old) for more.
