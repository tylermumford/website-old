## Falling Spikes: The Journey, Chapter 1

Recently, I created an iPhone game called Falling Spikes. It's still being reviewed for publishing, but I wanted to write about the experience of creating this app. It's the first iPhone app I've ever made, and also the first game. This will be a short series of medium-length posts journaling the story. Chapter 1 sets the stage, while Chapter 2 (coming soon) covers the actual development of the app. 

### As Soon As...

... I got my first iPhone 4S, I wanted to make apps for these devices. The challenge of working with a new platform excited me, and I had grand visions of getting filthy rich from my first hit app. But at the time, I was still really new to programming, so I never took the time to learn how apps are actually made. I would watch some episodes from the original Objective-C Stanford course on iTunes U, but I didn't have a Mac, so I couldn't really follow along. So I contented myself by just writing down my brilliant ideas, never brushing off the dust:

- Meal planner & recipe book for college students
- Spending tally/budget for shopping trips
- Time-telling practice for kids
- Basic math practice for kids
- Simple calorie counter for casual dieters

If you want to use any of these ideas, feel free. Just let me know how they work out. ;)

### Web Dev With Mobile in Mind

So I left the iOS development world in the back of my mind and focused on web development, a field with a much lower entry bar (and jobs in my area). I had fun learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I started to genuinely enjoy working web dev. Luckily, my obsession with iPhones paid off in this area, too.

This was around 2012. Responsive web design was starting to become a thing, but many websites still did very little to be mobile-friendly. The company I started working for (a music store) knew that mobile browsing was quickly becoming more important, so I easily persuaded them to let me improve the mobile experience of their site. Looking back, this experience was incredibly helpful to my career. I wish I'd kept a copy of the work I did there, but the company switched to Shopify and I didn't get the chance.

Over the years, I moved around the state and eventually came to Southern Utah University. I was blessed to get a job in the Web Services department, which has treated me extremely well. I love living in Cedar City, and I'd almost be content to keep working this job forever. Web Services has given me the opportunity to study CSS and large websites in detail, and I'm starting to think that I could specialize in large-scale CSS architecture someday. But I digress. 

### Running Into Falling Spikes

Let's get back to the story of the game. SUU--and probably every other reputable college--is a great place to meet smart people and share ideas. In this case, I met my friend Scott Chapman, a business student and aspiring entrepreneur. One day he asked, "Hey, do you want to see some games I'm making?"

He showed me several games that he'd made with Game Maker on his laptop. Graphically, they weren't much to look at, but they were *fun*. I'm not saying he could start a game design studio tomorrow (though I wouldn't put it past him), but these games had a real spark of fun and enjoyment to them. Using the mouse and arrow keys felt fine, but when I imagined playing these games on a touchscreen, they instantly became ten times better. "Have you ever thought about making these games for iPhone," I asked. Boom.
